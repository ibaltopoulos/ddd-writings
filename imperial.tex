\title{Agile development in a financial services startup: How ``code first''
helps us release 15 times a day}
\date{October 25, 2011}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Orbis is a global investment firm managing USD25B for institutional
clients and high net-worth investors.
%
Our vision is to 'democratize' high quality investments by offering
them direct to everyday investors, through our new online platform
OrbisAccess.
%
In this talk we go over our journey so far to build a high-tech
startup from the ground up.
%
We reflect on how domain driven design (DDD) and ``code first'' have
helped us keep our core model clean from technology distractions,
create testable code, and remain flexible in light of business
requirement changes.
%
Finally we share our experience using continuous delivery to quickly
evolve functionality, reduce the risk of deploying to production, and
get real-time feedback on the progress of the entire project.

\section{Structure}
\subsection{Intro (10 mins, Paul?)}
I think Orbis has an exceptionally good back story that fits perfectly with his first and second points.  Additionally it sets us apart from the rest of the financial services industry.  It's the Allan Gray story as motivation for why we are doing what we are doing.  The crux of the story is that he's had the vision and inclination for a long time but for retail to be successful the cost of business needs to be lower and we are using technology to do so.

The only downside I see about this as the opening / motivation is that planning for retirement is probably not on the minds of the students.  However we can draw them in by asking about their parents, and if they plan to live long enough to get to their parent's age

\subsection{OA Operations Areas (10 mins, Alvin?)}
The motivation sets up what we are doing and why IT is the single most important tool for us winning in the retail space.  Then we move into all the operational aspects of the business - enumerating marketing, information gathering by customers, account opening, transactions, funds, customer support.  And at a high level at this point we can discuss how we are using technology to make the operational area better for the customer and cheaper for us.

\subsection{Drill down (20 mins, Ioannis, Qi)}
Finally we can drill into one or two of these areas to explain in detail what technology choices we've made and why and pros, the cons, the impact to schedule, the skills on the team we need to be successful in that area etc.  What areas we need to drill down on would still be tbd.

\section{Points}

\paragraph{Guiding Agile Principles}
In preparing these slides I was trying to come up with an inspiring
opening that would grab everyone's attention.
%
So as I was searching around the web for inspiration I remembered the
principles behind the Agile Manifesto which, I must admit, hadn't
looked at since I took Susan EisenBach's Advanced Topics in Software
Engineering course a few years ago.
%
As I was reading them I slowly realised how relevant they are to our
technology team and I will explain how in a moment.
%
So if you forget everything else I say today at least remember to go
read those principles. These principles should be the heart and soul
of any software development team.
%
It takes 5 minutes to read them, but much longer for your entire team
to master them.

Let me highlight some items on that list.

\begin{itemize}
\item Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early
  delivery of valuable software

\item Build projects around motivated individuals.  Give them the
  environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job
  done.

\item Simplicity --the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--
  is essential.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Great but we're a startup}
\begin{itemize}
\item Satisfy the customer, which customer? we don't even know who to
  target yet!

\item Where are all of these motivated individuals hidding?

\item Easier said than done when you have the FSA.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{What matters when developing code in a startup
  environment?}
\begin{itemize}
\item the software artefact must always work

\item the time between inception of the idea until we have a working
  version of it must be minimal

\item  small incremental changes are preferred to big bang changes

\item  business functionality is preferred over framework code

\item  good programmers are hard to find and unfortunately they don't
  show up when you need them

\item  your business team is also trying to make sense of this all so
  they don't have the answers for you. You need to make an
  educated guess and write coded flexible enough to anticipate
  the changes.

\item  you are always faced with the choice: should I just fix this
  now or should I write an automated script to fix it?
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Additionally being a web startup}
\begin{itemize}
\item  your users expect you to be able to be able to quickly fix the
website

\item  you don't need release cycles like desktop software. Delivery
  of your software is done automatically for you. Even if it's a
  large application there are ways to deliver it in pieces,
  progressive JavaScript downloading, requests from multiple
  hosts with different names, etc

\item  it's easy to fake a demo. Midway through you switch from the
  production URl to localhost. Alvin you don't hear that from me.
\end{itemize}






\paragraph{Starting development from the database model is inefficient}
\begin{itemize} 
\item for every new concept/table you introduce, you have to create
  data access objects in the object language

\item it gives higher priority to data organization rather than data
  usage
\item your persistence mechanism imposes a relational way of viewing
  the world. For some applications the relational model is not
  appropriate. A hierarchical representation would have been better

\item you don't even know the domain yet, we're discovering it as we
  go along
\item during the ramp up stage of the project there are frequent
  changes to the model. That means constant code churn
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{What is code first or domain driven design?}
- object oriented programming done right

\paragraph{Why is it good?}
